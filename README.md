\# 📈 Monte Carlo Simulator – Mobile Optimized Version



A Streamlit-powered app that runs Monte Carlo simulations to model future price distributions using geometric Brownian motion, now optimized for \*\*handheld and touch-friendly devices\*\*.



> \*\*Note:\*\* This build is derived from `montecarlo\_J-simulator`, restructured for responsive layout and compact usability on phones and tablets.
